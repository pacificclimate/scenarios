"temp","Temperature*","Degrees C","Degrees C","* Temperature refers to the average of the nighttime low (minimum temperature) and the daytime high (maximum temperature) temperatures."
"prec","Precipitation* (rain plus snow)","mm per day","percent","* Precipitation (rain plus snow) refers to the total amount of water that results from rainfall plus the amount of water that would result from melting of fallen snow."
"pass","Precipitation as Snow*","mm","percent","* 'Precipitation as Snow' is a derived variable, calculated from GCM projected total precipitation (rain and snow) as well as temperature as per (Wang et al, 2006).<br/><br/>Annual values of this derived variable have been corrected based on an empirical relationship between computed and observed values in BC. This correction is not yet available for seasonal values so the annual values may differ from the seasonal totals"
"dg05","Growing Degree-Days*","degree-days","degree-days","* Growing Degree-Days (GDDs) is a derived variable that indicates the amount of heat energy available for plant growth, useful for determining the growth potential of crops in a given area. It is calculated by multiplying the number of days that the mean daily temperature exceeded 5&deg;C by the number of degrees above that threshold. For example, if a given day saw an average temperature of 8&deg;C (3&deg;C above the 5&deg;C threshold), that day contributed 3 GDDs to the total. If a month had 15 such days, and the rest of the days had mean temperatures below the 5&deg;C threshold, that month would result in 45 GDDs.<br/><br/>The method used to compute degree-days from monthly data is a development on (Wang et al, 2006) by PCIC, as will be documented in &quot;Developing Improved Degree-Day Regressions&quot; (Bronaugh et al, in review)."
"dl18","Heating Degree-Days*","degree-days","degree-days","* Heating Degree-Days (HDDs) is a derived variable that can be useful for indicating energy demand (i.e. the need to heat homes, etc.). It is calculated by multiplying the number of days that the average (mean) daily temperature is below 18&deg;C by the number of degrees below that threshold. For example, if a given day saw an average (mean) temperature of 14&deg;C (4&deg;C below the 18&deg;C threshold), that day contributed 4 HDDs to the total. If a month had 15 such days, and the rest of the days had average (mean) temperatures above the 18&deg;C threshold, that month would result in 60 HDDs. <br/><br/>The method used to compute degree-days from monthly data is a development on (Wang et al, 2006) by PCIC, as will be documented in &quot;Developing Improved Degree-Day Regressions&quot; (Bronaugh et al, in review)."
"nffd","Frost-Free Days*","days","days","* Frost-free days is a derived variable referring to the number of days that the minimum daily temperature stayed above 0&deg;C, useful for determining the suitability of growing certain crops in a given area. The method used to compute this on a monthly basis is from (Wang et al, 2006)<br/><br/>Annual values of this derived variable have been corrected based on an empirical relationship between computed and observed values in BC. This correction is not yet available for seasonal values so the annual values may differ from the seasonal totals"
